# Click and Drag to Scroll

This is a relatively basic Auto Hot Key script that allows you to:
- Click and hold a mouse button (Right or Middle) and then move the cursor to scroll
- Toggle scroll mode with `CTRL+ALT+T` instead of clicking and holding the mouse button
- Reverse scrolling setting is included at the top of the `ClickDragScroll.ahk` file, along with some other settings
