# Click and Drag to Scroll

- `ClickDragScroll.ahk` is for AutoHotKey on Windows
- `ClickDragScroll.py` is for Python on Linux (do not use on Windows)

- Click and hold a mouse button (default Middle) and then move the cursor to scroll
  - Vertical, horizontal, and even diagonal scrolling works!
- Toggle scroll mode with `CTRL+ALT+T` (`CTRL+SHIFT+F12` in the Python version for Linux) as an alternative to clicking and holding the mouse button
- Reverse scrolling setting is included at the top of the `ClickDragScroll.ahk` or `ClickDragScroll.py`  file, along with some other settings
