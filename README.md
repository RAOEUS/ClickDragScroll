# Click and Drag to Scroll

ClickDragScroll.ahk is an AutoHotKey script. ClickDragScroll.py is a Python version written for use with Linux

- Click and hold a mouse button (default Middle) and then move the cursor to scroll
  - Vertical, horizontal, and even diagonal scrolling works!
- Toggle scroll mode with `CTRL+ALT+T` as an alternative to clicking and holding the mouse button
	- This is only in the .ahk script so far
- Reverse scrolling setting is included at the top of the `ClickDragScroll.ahk` or `ClickDragScroll.py`  file, along with some other settings
