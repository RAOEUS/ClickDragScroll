# Click and Drag to Scroll

- `ClickDragScroll.ahk` is for AutoHotKey on Windows
- `ClickDragScroll.py` is for Python on Linux (do not use on Windows)
  - I have no clue if this works on Mac or not, because I don't have a Mac to test on
  - Untested on Wayland, and unlikely to work. I recommend using X11, if you can.

## How To Use
- Click and hold a mouse button (default Middle, can be changed in settings) and then move the cursor to scroll
  - Vertical, horizontal, and even diagonal scrolling works!
- Toggle _scroll mode_ with `CTRL+ALT+T` (`CTRL+SHIFT+F12` in the Python version for Linux) as an alternative to clicking and holding the mouse button
- Reverse scrolling setting is included at the top of the `ClickDragScroll.ahk` or `ClickDragScroll.py`  file, along with some other settings
